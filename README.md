# Project 3: MERN-stack application

Scope: One week (group of three) to create MERN-stack application.
Realization: As a registered user you can add food items from stock to your personal inventory. You can then find recipes matching your personal inventory as well as find&share food via a mapbox map (using “React-Map-GL”).
